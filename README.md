# crypto-enigma
An attempt at emulating the Enigma machine from WWII.

This is just based on my memory from when I had to a research project on Alan Turing.

Enigma machine was an encryption device used by the Axis powers in World War II. The device used a plugboard, and four rotors to encrypt messages. This created both a strength and a weakness in the device: constantly changing state, bust also an initial state.
