# crypto-enigma
An attempt at emulating the Enigma machine from WWII.

This is just based on my memory from when I had to a research project on Alan Turing. The main purpose of this project is just to be an exploration into cryptography for me.

Enigma machine was an encryption device used by the Axis powers in World War II. The device used a plugboard, and four rotors to encrypt messages. This created both a strength and a weakness in the device: constantly changing state, bust also an initial state.

In case this piqued your interest, here are two wikipedia links for more information on the device.
